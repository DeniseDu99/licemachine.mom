            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>The back-to-school season is a peak time for head lice transmission. Understanding how to effectively prevent head lice infection is crucial for every family. Head lice are common parasites that spread through direct contact, especially among children. Here are 7 practical tips to help protect your child from head lice.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Regularly Check Hair and Scalp</h2>
                <p>The first step in preventing head lice is regular checking. Check your child's hair and scalp at least once a week, especially behind the ears and around the neck area, which are the most common habitats for head lice. Use a fine-toothed comb or a professional lice comb to carefully examine under bright light. Head lice are grayish-brown, about the size of a sesame seed, while nits (lice eggs) are white or yellow small dots that stick to the hair roots.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Teach Children Not to Share Personal Items</h2>
                <p>Head lice mainly spread through direct contact, but they can also spread through sharing hats, combs, hair clips, headphones, and other personal items. Teach your child not to share these items with others, especially at school or in other public places.</p>
                
                <h2>3. Use Preventive Hair Care Products</h2>
                <p>There are some hair care products on the market containing natural ingredients (such as lavender, tea tree oil, or lemongrass) that are said to have lice-repellent effects. Although the effectiveness of these products has not been scientifically proven, many parents find they have some preventive effect. You can use these products before your child goes to school as an additional preventive measure.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Tie Up Long Hair</h2>
                <p>If your child has long hair, it is recommended to tie it up in a ponytail, braid, or bun. This can reduce the chance of contact with other people's hair and lower the risk of infection.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Regularly Wash Bedding and Toys</h2>
                <p>Head lice can survive on bedsheets, pillowcases, plush toys, and other items for 24-48 hours. Regularly washing these items in hot water (at least 54Â°C) and drying them at high temperatures can kill any potential head lice. Items that cannot be washed can be sealed in a plastic bag for 2 weeks or frozen in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Use Electronic Lice Machine for Preventive Treatment</h2>
                <p>Our electronic lice machine can not only be used to treat existing head lice infections but also as a preventive measure for regular use. The electronic lice machine dries and kills head lice and nits through physical methods, without the need for chemical drugs, and is harmless to the skin and hair. Using it once a month during the high season for head lice can effectively prevent infection.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Understand School's Head Lice Policy</h2>
                <p>Understand your child's school's head lice policy and handling procedures. Many schools notify parents when head lice cases are discovered, so you can be more vigilant and take preventive measures. If the school notifies you of a head lice outbreak, immediately check your child and take necessary preventive measures.</p>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Preventing head lice infection requires continuous attention and active action from parents. Through regular checking, educating children about good hygiene habits, using preventive products and electronic lice machines, you can greatly reduce the risk of your child getting head lice. Remember, early detection and prompt treatment are key to controlling the spread of head lice.</p>
